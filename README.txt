This is the main folder for the first Laboratory of the Integrated System Architecture course.
The first LAB is based on the design and the implementation of a digital filter.

We have two different folders here:
-  drawio_wavedrom_files_innovus is just a folder in which have been collected
all the different .jpg and .gif files, representing the two different devices at the schematic and the layout level.
Also waveform picture and VHDL sketch are here collected;

- lab1: this is subdivided in:
	- first_version: the first version of the IIR fitler
	- optimized_version: the optmized version of the IIR filter
Then, each of the two folder has been organized almost in the same way, following the directives
of the Laboratories file.
